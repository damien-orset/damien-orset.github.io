# My mission

OnPrem migration to GCP:
- Redesign of feed pipelines (file, event, database synchronization)
- Migration of Oracle + SQLServer data to BigQuery (integrity checks)
- Redesign of processing (PLSQL to DBT)
- Migration and connection of reports (BO, PBI, BO)

Full industrialization via Terraform and CICD gitlab (framework [ToBeContinuous](https://to-be-continuous.gitlab.io/doc/intro/))

Finops (tracking cloud consumption through detailed reports, labeling resources for cost distribution, continuous optimization of queries)

Implementation of good data architecture practices: naming, organization, security
